# Vehicle_Detection_FinalYear_Project
Haar Cascades Classifier used to detect and track vehicles.
This project is aimed at detecting the vehicles (cars) and keeping count on them using Haar Cascade Classifier. The haar cascade classifier was built using 1000 positive images and 2500 negative images. 
The project is in its initial version (v1.0) and later will be developed into an end to end complete project with a clean interface that provides the user with better feasibility.

To run the program:
  1. Load the cars6.xml for the project (there are haar-cascade classifier to try out....) 
  2. Then run the vehicle_detection.py
